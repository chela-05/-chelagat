Am a student at KESOGON JUNIOR SCHOOL<br>
I have watched myself grow through my educational journey with an admirable sense of focus and resilience. From the early stages of her studies, she has always approached learning with curiosity and determination, consistently pushing herself to reach higher goals. Education, for her, has never been just about passing exams, but about building a foundation for the future and developing the discipline to overcome challenges.

What makes Mercy stand out is how she balances this academic dedication with her love for **football**. On the field, my passion comes alive i play with energy, teamwork, and strategy, qualities that reflect the same drive i bring to my studies. Football has not only sharpened my discipline and teamwork skills but also taught me patience, perseverance, and leadership.

Together, my education journey and football passion tell a story of a young girl who works hard, thinks strategically, and always pushes forward with determination. Mercy is not only building her future through learning but also shaping her character through sport—making her a well-rounded individual with the potential to inspire many.<br>




At just 14 years old, I have already discovered a passion that excites me every single day — **programming**. Over the last three years, I have immersed myself in the world of **front-end development**, learning and mastering languages such as **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery**.

What started as simple curiosity has now grown into real skill and confidence. Today, I can proudly say that I have developed the ability to build beautiful, functional websites from scratch. Each line of code I write teaches me something new, and every project feels like a step closer to achieving my dreams in the tech world.

This journey has not been mine alone. I owe a huge part of my growth and success to my **Digital Literacy mentor**, whose guidance, patience, and encouragement have shaped me into the programmer I am becoming. Their support gave me the courage to take on challenges, experiment without fear, and believe that even at a young age, I can create something meaningful.

I am excited about what lies ahead — to keep learning, to innovate, and to inspire others my age to see that with passion and the right mentorship, anything is possible.
